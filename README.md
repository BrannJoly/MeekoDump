# MeekoDump
The standard way of getting all your kid's pictures at the end of the year is to go in the media page from the Meeko app, click on EACH PICTURE, select "open in web browser", and then save the picture from your browser. Rinse and repeat.

This litle program masquerades as the Meeko app, connects using your credentials, and dumps all the pictures in a Meeko folder on your desktop
